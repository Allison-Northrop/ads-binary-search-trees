## Assignment - Week 2

### Core

1. Read through the existing code in `src/data_structures/binary_search_tree.js` and ensure you understand how it works
1. Implement `BinarySearchTree.insert()` so that it passes the tests
1. Read through the existing code in `src/data_structures/red_black_tree.js` and ensure you understand how it works
1. Uncomment the line in the `src/data_structures/binary_search_tree.test.js` that adds red-black trees to the list of data structures to test
1. Using the binary search tree implementation as a starting point, implement the `insert`, `lookup` and `forEach` methods for red-black trees so that they pass both the binary search tree and red-black tree tests

### Optional

1. Test and implement `BinarySearchTree.delete()`
1. Test and implement `RedBlackTree.delete()`
1. Implement a visualization of a user list that relies on a red-black tree
